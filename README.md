# GuessEstate 🏡💸

--GuessEstate** is a fun and educational web app built with Flask where users try to guess the price of houses and apartments. The closer your guess is to the actual price, the higher your score!

## Features

- Displays a random house or apartment image.
- Users can input their guess for the price.
- Calculates a score based on how close the guess is to the real price.

## Future Plans!!

This project is just beginning — here’s what we plan to add:

- **Real Listings**: Fetch random apartments/houses from real estate websites or APIs so users can guess actual market prices.
- **Competitive Mode**: Track scores and compete with other users online.
- **Leaderboard**: Show top scores for each day/week to make it more competitive.
- **User Accounts**: Let people register and track their progress over time.
- **Improved Frontend**: Make the interface more interactive and visually appealing with CSS or a UI framework.
